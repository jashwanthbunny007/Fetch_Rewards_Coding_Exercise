# Fetch_Rewards_Coding_Exercise



This repository contains the artifacts related to the Fetch Rewards Database project. The project involves analyzing sample data, identifying discrepancies, designing an efficient database schema, and constructing SQL queries to answer specific business questions. Below is a summary of the contents and purpose of each file in the repository.

Repository Contents:

1. FetchRewards.ipynb
Description: This Jupyter Notebook contains the data analysis performed on the provided sample data.
Contents:
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify any patterns or anomalies.
Visualization of key insights derived from the data.

3. ERDiagram_Fetch.png
Description: An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that illustrates the proposed database schema.
Contents:
Entities and their attributes.
Relationships between entities.
Cardinalities and constraints to ensure data integrity.

5. Email_to_stakeholder.txt
Description: A draft email intended for stakeholders.
Contents:
Summary of data analysis findings.
Description of data discrepancies encountered.
List of additional information required from stakeholders to optimize data assets.
Questions and clarifications needed to finalize the database schema and ensure it meets business requirements.

4. Fetch_SQLqueries.sql
Description: A collection of SQL queries designed to answer specific predetermined questions from a business stakeholder.
Contents:
Queries to retrieve specific insights and reports from the database.



How to Use This Repository
Data Analysis: Open FetchRewards.ipynb to review the data analysis process and insights. This notebook provides a comprehensive understanding of the data and highlights areas that need attention.

Database Schema: Refer to ERDiagram_Fetch.png to understand the structure of the proposed database. This diagram is essential for database design and implementation.

Stakeholder Communication: Use Email_to_stakeholder.txt as a template to communicate with stakeholders. It outlines key findings and solicits additional information necessary for refining the database schema.

SQL Queries: Execute the queries in Fetch_SQLqueries.sql against your database to answer the predetermined business questions. Each query is designed to extract meaningful insights from the data.
